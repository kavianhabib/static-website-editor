A friend of mine wanted to have an interactive website editor but they did not have the source code for their .Net website
and did not want to build their POS and website from scratch. So I had to improvise and build an interactive 
desktop application to modify the static part of their website.

## How it Works
I have used python, tkinter, and pandas library to read cshtml and css files. After modification the program will create new modified
cshtml and css files.
